                Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the 
                simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, including learning, reasoning, and 
                self-correction. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms 
                that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without 
                being explicitly programmed.
